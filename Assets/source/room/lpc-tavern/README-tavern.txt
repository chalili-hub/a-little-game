Assets to build taverns, inns, bars, simple kitchens, and breweries, in the style of the Liberated Pixel Cup.

Includes furniture (tables, chairs, stools), various stoves/fireplaces, pots, large copper brewing vessels, lighting, glassware/utensils, food, busts, rugs, crests/shields, banners, and more. As a bonus, also includes simple animations for 3 instruments (lute, flute, and drum), compatible with the Universal LPC spritesheet. 

Sample scenes created in Tiled <http://www.mapeditor.org> are included. See this file for examples of how to play the various animations as well. 

Note: the preview images (and scenes) use tiles from other submissions which are not covered under the license of this submission; see preview/CREDITS*.txt for details
